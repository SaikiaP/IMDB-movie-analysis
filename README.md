# IMDB-movie-analysis
Welcome to the IMDB Movie Analysis project! In this project, I have analyzed the IMDB movie database using SQL to gain valuable insights into the movie industry. By leveraging SQL queries, joins, subqueries, and other SQL features, I have explored the database, performed various analyses, and drawn meaningful conclusions.


# Project Overview
The "Segment 7-Recommendations.docx" document contains the final recommendations and insights derived from the analysis. It showcases the key findings and provides recommendations for Bolly Movies, an Indian film production company, on content focus, production statistics, genre popularity, crew members, and more.
The "Relationshp between the tables of imdb database" diagram illustrates the relationships between the tables in the IMDB database. It helps in understanding the database structure and the connections between different entities.
The "IMDB movie analysis - final project.sql" file is the SQL script used to perform the analysis. It includes the SQL queries and statements used to extract insights from the database. The script covers various aspects of the analysis, such as movie release trends, genre analysis, ratings analysis, crew members' contributions, and more.

# Key Learnings
This project was a hands-on learning experience that enhanced my SQL skills and analytical abilities.
I gained proficiency in using SQL to explore and analyze large datasets, extract relevant information, and draw valuable insights.
Through this project, I developed a deeper understanding of the movie industry, including trends, genre preferences, and factors influencing movie ratings.
